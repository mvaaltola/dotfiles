# By default, espanso uses the "Auto" backend which should work well in most cases,
# but you may want to try the "Clipboard" or "Inject" backend in case of issues.

# Enable/disable the config auto-reload after a file change is detected.
auto_restart: true

# Because injecting long texts char-by-char is a slow operation, espanso automatically
# uses the clipboard if the text is longer than 'clipboard_threshold' characters.
